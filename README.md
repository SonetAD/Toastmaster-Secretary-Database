Hi there,this is a database management software.I've created it to keep track of my club(Dhaka Toastmaster Club) database.
As I am a secretary of my club,my job is to keep track all of our club meeting information.Doing this manually was a hidious job for me.Thats why I decided to make this little utility to help me.

Features of this app:

1.Insert data without duplication.

2.Incredible searching capability.

3.Set important note & reminder for next meeting.

4.Quick search option.

As I said before,it is a small utility for my personal use,I just focused it's practical use.Thats why I didn't add any GUI or extra accessibility in this app.This is mainly a terminal bassed software.
I will add new features if needed in future.If you are interested about it feel free to update or use it.
